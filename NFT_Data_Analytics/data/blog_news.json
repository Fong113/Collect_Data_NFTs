The Bitcoin (BTC) network is about to undergo a set of upgrades, which are expected to essentially put an end to BRC-20 tokens as well as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) known as Bitcoin Ordinals minted on the network. In an X post on Dec. 6, 2023, Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr said that a loophole in the Bitcoin blockchain made it possible for users ‚Äúto spam the blockchain,‚Äù calling Inscriptions ‚Äî a way of storing metadata on the blockchain ‚Äî a ‚Äúbug.‚Äù PSA: ‚ÄúInscriptions‚Äù are exploiting a vulnerability in #Bitcoin Core to spam the blockchain.

Yet, despite technical issues, Bitcoin-based NFTs turned out to be pretty much profitable for miners as the total amount of Ordinals fees has come close to $150 million, as per data from Dune. Bitcoin Ordinals are non-fungible asset artifacts that enable the inscribing of data onto a satoshi, the smallest division of a Bitcoin. Since its launch in January 2023, the protocol has seen the inscription trend take off, leading to thousands being minted on the Bitcoin network. This has caused congestion and spikes in transaction fees, reaching a peak in April and May 2023. Read more: Binance lists ORDI, confuses it with Bitcoin Ordinals project Follow Us on Google News",

According to an X thread by Yuga Labs‚Äò smart contract developer, @0xQuit, the newly introduced CryptoPunks721 wrapper operates on a permissionless basis and utilizes Larva Labs‚Äò PunksData smart contract for on-chain metadata. The primary objective behind developing the new wrapper is to streamline the trading of NFTs from the CryptoPunks collection, originally minted in 2017, predating the widespread acceptance of the ERC-721 standard in January 2018. Last week, Yuga finalized a series of interconnected contracts that unlock new possibilities across our projects. They\u0027ll start simple, but they\u0027re designed to allow evolution over time.

It is noteworthy that last year, after the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, which was one of the leading investors of Solana, many predicted the end of the ecosystem.

The current price of Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) sits at $24.78, a figure which, however, still represents an approximate 85% decline from its all-time high of $166.40 reached in March 2012. Marathon Digital stock 1 year price chart | Source: Google Finance The stock‚Äôs remarkable performance coincides with pivotal developments in the cryptocurrency market, particularly the anticipated decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the approval of the spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), expected by Jan. 10. The approval of this ETF is expected to bring a massive influx of capital into the market, with major institutions like BlackRock and Grayscale potentially offering it to their clients. Amidst these market speculations, Marathon Digital‚Äôs CEO and Chairman, Fred Thiel, has pointed to the company‚Äôs ‚Äúsignificant progress‚Äù in strengthening its financial position, a factor he considers crucial in the lead-up to the Bitcoin halving event scheduled for April 2024. You might also like: Bitcoin halving 2024: Expert predictions point to major BTC price surge This BTC halving event, which occurs approximately every four years, is expected to impact miners‚Äô rewards and has been a topic of discussion within the industry regarding its potential effects on profitability. This comes after recent reports that Marathon Digital has recently announced a significant move towards increasing its operational capacity. The BTC mining firm has formalized a purchase agreement to acquire two fully operational Bitcoin mining sites, which together offer 390 megawatts of capacity. As earlier reported by crypto.news, the deal, valued at $178.6 million, represents a significant shift for Marathon Digital as the company moves from its previous asset-light structure to managing a more diverse range of Bitcoin mining operations. Financially, Marathon Digital has demonstrated a significant turnaround, reporting a net income of $64.1 million in the third quarter, a stark contrast to a net loss of $72.5 million during the same period in the previous year. This improvement in financial performance is attributed to a 467% increase in Bitcoin production coupled with a 32% rise in the average price of Bitcoin, resulting in a substantial growth in quarterly revenues to $97.8 million. Valuation challenges in wake of financial success Despite these developments, Marathon Digital has not escaped scrutiny as MinerMetrics has identified the company as one of the most overvalued in the crypto mining sector, citing a high enterprise value-to-sales (EV/S) ratio of 5.6. This elevated valuation is influenced by Marathon‚Äôs visibility and favorable standing among institutional investors, which has facilitated better access to capital and, consequently, a higher market valuation. MARA‚Äôs power costs are some of the highest among public miners. However, Bitcoin transaction fees peaked at a record two-year high, thereby adding around 30% higher mining rewards for miners. Looking ahead, Marathon Digital is positioning itself for further growth, with plans to increase its hash rate by approximately 30% in 2024.
